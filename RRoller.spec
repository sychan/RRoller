        A 'typedef' can also be used to define compound or container
        objects, like lists, maps, and structures.  The standard KBase
        convention is to use structures, as shown here, to define the
        input and output of your function.  Here the input is a
        reference to the Assembly data object, a workspace to save
        output, and a length threshold for filtering.

        To define lists and maps, use a syntax similar to C++ templates
        to indicate the type contained in the list or map.  For example:

            list <string> list_of_strings;
            mapping <string, int> map_of_ints;

        visualizations in the Narrative.  'report_name' and 'report_ref' are
        special output fields- if defined, the Narrative can automatically
        render your Report.
